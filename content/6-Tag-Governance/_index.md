### What is AWS Config?

AWS Config  is a fully managed service that provides you with resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to use security and governance. With AWS Config, you can discover existing AWS resources, record configurations for third-party resources, export a complete inventory of your resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource was configured at any point in time. These capabilities use compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.
